At birth,\n    the human cerebellar cortex is still immature, making it vulnerable\n    to perinatal events. Moreover, a correlation between cerebellar\n    functions and the deficits observed in children having suffered from\n    AOP has been demonstrated. Yet, the cerebellar alterations\n    underpinning this link remain poorly understood. To shed light on\n    the involvement of the cerebellum in perinatal hypoxia-related\n    sequelae, we developed a mouse model of AOP. In previous works, we\n    found that IH induces oxidative stress in the developing cerebellum\n    as shown by the overexpression of genes involved in reactive oxygen\n    species production, and the under-expression of genes encoding\n    antioxidant enzymes. These alterations suggest a failure of the\n    defense system against oxidative stress and could be responsible for\n    neuronal death in the cerebellum. Based on these results, we\n    performed a transcriptomic study of the genes involved in the\n    processes that occur during cerebellar development. We analyzed the\n    expression of these genes at various developmental stages and in\n    different cell types, by real time PCR. This enabled us to pinpoint\n    a timeframe of vulnerability at P8, which represents the age with\n    the highest number of downregulated genes in the cerebellum.\n    Moreover, we identified several molecular pathways that are impacted\n    by our IH protocol, such as proliferation, migration, and\n    differentiation. This suggests that IH can modify the development of\n    various cells, and then contribute to the histological and\n    behavioral deficits already observed in this model. Overall, our\n    data indicate that the cerebellum is highly sensitive to IH, and\n    provide elements to better understand the pathophysiology of AOP by\n    deciphering its cellular and molecular causal mechanisms. In the\n    long term, the present results could lead to the identification of\n    novel therapeutic targets to improve the clinical management of this\n    highly prevalent pathology.}\n}\nFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nRodriguez-Duboc, A., Basille-Duguay, M., Debonne, A., Rivière, M.-A.,\nVaudry, D., & Burel, D.

    "text": "2.2 Removing implausible rides\nThen, we are going to filter out rides that are implausible (i.e. too short, too long, made too quickly, etc). We will compute distances (and speeds), which we can do in one of two ways:\n\nAn accurate way where we turn our lat/lng coordinates into two 2D points on a projected coordinate system, which is a small version of the globe (flattened and corrected for distortion) that can be used for area and distance calculations.\nA quick and dirty way using the haversine function to compute the “distance on a sphere” between the two sets of coordinates.\n\nN.B.: The distances/time/speed thresholds I use here are arbitrary. Choose what makes sense depending on your domain knowledge.\n\n\nIn-RAM\nOut-of-RAM\n\n\n\nPrecise distance with sf::st_distance:\nFirst, let’s create a new dataset with a POINT geometry for both start and end stations’ positions:\n\nrides_geom &lt;- (\n  rides\n  |&gt; st_as_sf(coords = c(\"start_lng\", \"start_lat\"), remove = FALSE, crs = 4326)\n  |&gt; st_set_geometry(\"start_pos\")\n  |&gt; mutate(end_pos = map2(end_lng, end_lat, \\(x, y) st_point(c(x, y))) |&gt; st_sfc(crs = 4326))\n  |&gt; as.data.table()\n)\n\nThen, use those two points to compute an accurate distance between each rides’ start_pos and end_pos, and use that distance to filter implausible rides:\n\nrides_clean_geom &lt;- (\n  rides_geom[\n    , ride_dist_m := st_distance(st_transform(start_pos, 5069), st_transform(end_pos, 5069), by_element = TRUE)\n  ## Remove rides that loop on themselves, are too short (&lt;= 100 m), or too long (&gt;= 30 km)\n  ][start_station_id != end_station_id | as.numeric(ride_dist_m) %between% c(100, 30000)\n  ## Add ride duration and speed info\n  ][, ride_dur_min := difftime(ended_at, started_at, units = \"mins\") |&gt; abs() |&gt; as.numeric()\n  ][, ride_speed_km_h := fifelse(ride_dur_min == 0, NA, (as.numeric(ride_dist_m) / 1000) / (ride_dur_min / 60))\n  ## Remove rides that are too fast (&lt; 5 min) or too long (&gt; 1 day)\n  ][ride_dur_min %between% c(5, 1440)\n  ## Remove rides that have implausible speeds (&gt; 40 km/h for regular bikes, and 60 km/h for electric ones)\n  ][ (rideable_type == \"classic_bike\" & ride_speed_km_h &lt;= 40)\n     | (rideable_type == \"electric_bike\" & ride_speed_km_h &lt;= 60)\n  ## Removing the new columns now that the cleaning is done\n  ][, let(ride_dist_m = NULL, ride_dur_min = NULL, ride_speed_km_h = NULL)]\n)\n\n\n\nTime difference of 2.378 mins\n\n\nApproximate distance with the haversine:\nThe haversine function computes the distance between two points on a sphere, based on their coordinates. But the Earth isn’t a sphere, so the estimated distance will only be approximate. However, for small distances, it’s accurate enough for our goals. And it’s much faster !\n\nrides_clean_haversine &lt;- (\n  rides[\n    , ride_dist_m := geosphere::distHaversine(.SD[, .(start_lng, start_lat)], .SD[, .(end_lng, end_lat)])\n  ## Remove rides that loop on themselves, are too short (&lt;= 100 m), or too long (&gt;= 30 km)\n  ][start_station_id != end_station_id | ride_dist_m %between% c(100, 30000)\n  ## Add ride duration and speed info\n  ][, ride_dur_min := difftime(ended_at, started_at, units = \"mins\") |&gt;

    "text": "5.1 Station reference table\nOur rides data contains a small number of stations that each appear multiple times, either as the start or end of a ride. For each unique station, we will aggregate all the rides that start or end at that station, and set the station’s coordinates at the center of all the existing coordinates for that station. We have to way to go about this aggregation:\n\nAn accurate method such as st_centroid to find out the “center” of this set coordinates (using sf / the spatial extension).\nAn approximate method such as taking the average of all the lat/lng values we have in our rides data, for each station. This solution can be imprecise since it does not take the precision of each coordinate into account (e.g. giving more weight to more accurate coordinates), and the result will have a misleading level of accuracy due to the averaging process.\n\nLet’s do both and see how they compare !\n\n\n5.1.1 Using the accuracy-4 data\nHere, since we want to establish our “stations” lookup table from the “accuracy-4” data, we need to apply our has_acc4 function to rides_clean_geom_long to only keep entries (i.e. rides) with 4 or more decimals in their lat or lng coordinate:\n\n\nIn-RAM\nOut-of-RAM\n\n\n\n\nrides_clean_geom_long_acc4 &lt;- rides_clean_geom_long[has_acc4(lat) & has_acc4(lng), ]\n\n\n\nTime difference of 17.76 secs\n\n\n\n\n\n(tbl(con, \"rides_clean_geom_long\") \n  |&gt;

Or did it lower the overall accuracy of the stations’ locations by introducing lower-precision coordinates in the mix ?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n🔍 Comparing the location of each unique station\n\n\n\n\n\nLet’s compare both sources of data (filtered or not) and methods of combining locations (i.e. st_centroid vs simple average of lat/lng coordinates) by visualizing where they place the stations on a map:\n\nCodestations_locs &lt;- (\n  left_join(\n    ## Combining the results of geom & haversine stations from the unfiltered data\n    inner_join(tbl(con, \"stations_clean_geom\"), tbl(con, \"stations_clean_mean\"), join_by(id, name))\n    |&gt; mutate(\n      lat_unfiltered_mean = lat, lng_unfiltered_mean = lng,\n      lat_unfiltered_centroid = st_x(st_transform(pos, \"EPSG:5069\", \"EPSG:4326\")),\n      lng_unfiltered_centroid = st_y(st_transform(pos, \"EPSG:5069\", \"EPSG:4326\"))\n    )\n    |&gt; select(id, name, lat_unfiltered_mean, lng_unfiltered_mean, lat_unfiltered_centroid, lng_unfiltered_centroid),\n    ## Combining the results of geom & haversine stations from the filtered data\n    inner_join(tbl(con, \"stations_clean_acc4_geom\"), tbl(con, \"stations_clean_acc4_mean\"), join_by(id, name)) \n    |&gt; mutate(\n      lat_filtered_mean = lat, lng_filtered_mean = lng,\n      lat_filtered_centroid = st_x(st_transform(pos, \"EPSG:5069\", \"EPSG:4326\")), \n      lng_filtered_centroid = st_y(st_transform(pos, \"EPSG:5069\", \"EPSG:4326\"))\n    )\n    |&gt; select(id, name, lat_filtered_mean, lng_filtered_mean, lat_filtered_centroid, lng_filtered_centroid),\n    join_by(id, name)\n  )\n  |&gt; pivot_longer(cols = -c(id, name), names_sep = \"_\", names_to = c(\".value\", \"data_source\", \"method\"))\n  |&gt; collect()\n  |&gt; filter(!is.na(lat) & !is.na(lng))\n  |&gt; mutate(group = str_c(data_source, method, sep = \"_\"))\n)\n\nmy_markers &lt;- iconList(\n  filtered_centroid = makeIcon(\"C_green.png\", iconWidth = 45, iconHeight = 50),\n  filtered_mean = makeIcon(\"M_green.png\", iconWidth = 45, iconHeight = 50),\n  unfiltered_centroid = makeIcon(\"C_orange.png\", iconWidth = 45, iconHeight = 50),\n  unfiltered_mean = makeIcon(\"M_orange.png\", iconWidth = 45, iconHeight = 50)\n)\n\n(stations_locs\n  |&gt; st_as_sf(coords = c(\"lng\", \"lat\"), crs = 4326)\n  |&gt; leaflet()\n  |&gt; addTiles()\n  |&gt; fitBounds(-88.6, 41.8, -87, 42.1)\n  |&gt; addMarkers(\n    popup = ~sprintf(\"%s (id: %s)\", name, id),\n    icon = ~my_markers[group],\n    clusterOptions = markerClusterOptions()\n  )\n)\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you zoom on a specific station and click on its marker, you’ll see either 2 or 4 pins displayed. A station having only 2 pins is a station that was only present in the unfiltered data (i.e. only orange markers). For stations having 4 pins, they should have 2 orange and 2 green markers. In orange are the coordinates from the unfiltered data, while the filtered ones are in green. The M marker is for the mean method (average of lat/lng), while the C marker is for the centroid method.\nFirst, we can see that many of the stations with 4 pins line up pretty closely with a bike icon on the map, which should share the same name as the station closest to it. However, stations with only 2 orange pins are often much further away from any identifiable bike icon, or sometimes in the middle of a housing block. This suggest that stations only present in the unfiltered stations lookup table have unreliable locations.\nAs for stations present in both lookup tables, there seems to be virtually no differences in the 4 pins’ position. If we look at the lat/lng coordinates themselves, they only start differing at around the 8th or 9th digit after the decimal point, which is a difference in the range of a millimeter.\nTaken together, this means we should only use the filtered (accuracy-4) stations lookup table going forwards, but we use the average of lat/lng instead of the st_centroid if we want to save time on computations.\nPS: Abetter solution here would have been to query OpenStreetMap or Google Maps for the coordinates of each station, and build our lookup table with those."

However, how rows are matched (and how the ones not finding a match are handled) depends on the type of join:\n- Left joins match on the rows of the first (left) table. Unmatched rows from the left table will be kept, but not the right’s.\n- Right joins match on the rows of the second (right) table. Unmatched rows from the right table will be kept, but not the left’s.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample\n\n\n\nTo find out which country each city belongs to, we’re going to merge countries into cities.\nHere, we want to add data to the cities table by matching each city to a country (by their country_id). The ideal output would have the columns of cities first, and keep all rows from cities, even if unmatched: thus we will use a left join.\n\n\n\nAs a left join:\n\n\n\nTidyverse\ndata.table\n\n\n\n\nleft_join(cities, countries, by = \"country_id\", multiple = \"all\")\ndata.frame [10 x 4]\n\n\n\n\ncity_id\n\n\ncity\n\n\ncountry_id\n\n\ncountry\n\n\n\n\n\n1\n\n\nBarcelona\n\n\n9\n\n\nSpain\n\n\n\n\n2\n\n\nBergen\n\n\n8\n\n\nNorway\n\n\n\n\n3\n\n\nBern\n\n\n10\n\n\nNA\n\n\n\n\n4\n\n\nHelsinki\n\n\n4\n\n\nFinland\n\n\n\n\n5\n\n\nLinz\n\n\n1\n\n\nAustria\n\n\n\n\n6\n\n\nPunaauia\n\n\n6\n\n\nFrench Polynesia\n\n\n\n\n7\n\n\nQueenstown\n\n\n7\n\n\nNew-Zealand\n\n\n\n\n8\n\n\nRouen\n\n\n5\n\n\nFrance\n\n\n\n\n9\n\n\nSosua\n\n\n3\n\n\nDominican Republic\n\n\n\n\n10\n\n\nTrondheim\n\n\n8\n\n\nNorway\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndata.table natively only supports right joins\n\n\n\nIt filters the rows of the first table by those of the second (FIRST[SECOND]), but only keeps the unmatched rows from the second table.\n\nThe normal output of the joinCITIES[COUNTRIES, on = .(country_id)]\ndata.table [10 x 4]\n\n\n\n\ncity_id\n\n\ncity\n\n\ncountry_id\n\n\ncountry\n\n\n\n\n\n5\n\n\nLinz\n\n\n1\n\n\nAustria\n\n\n\n\nNA\n\n\nNA\n\n\n2\n\n\nCanada\n\n\n\n\n9\n\n\nSosua\n\n\n3\n\n\nDominican Republic\n\n\n\n\n4\n\n\nHelsinki\n\n\n4\n\n\nFinland\n\n\n\n\n8\n\n\nRouen\n\n\n5\n\n\nFrance\n\n\n\n\n6\n\n\nPunaauia\n\n\n6\n\n\nFrench Polynesia\n\n\n\n\n7\n\n\nQueenstown\n\n\n7\n\n\nNew-Zealand\n\n\n\n\n2\n\n\nBergen\n\n\n8\n\n\nNorway\n\n\n\n\n10\n\n\nTrondheim\n\n\n8\n\n\nNorway\n\n\n\n\n1\n\n\nBarcelona\n\n\n9\n\n\nSpain\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe unmatched rows from countries were kept, but not the ones from cities.

Sensory Substitution Devices (SSDs) have been promising Human-Machine Interfaces (HMI) to assist VIP. They re-code missing visual information as stimuli for other sensory channels. Our project redirects somehow from SSD’s initial ambition for a single universal integrated device that would replace the whole sense organ, towards common encoding schemes for multiple applications.\nSAM-Guide will search for the most natural way to give online access to geometric variables that are necessary to achieve a range of tasks without eyes. Defining such encoding schemes requires selecting a crucial set of geometrical variables, and building efficient and comfortable auditory and/or tactile signals to represent them. We propose to concentrate on action-perception loops representing target-reaching affordances, where spatial properties are defined as ego-centered deviations from selected beacons.\nThe same grammar of cues could better help VIP to get autonomy along with a range of vital or leisure activities. Among such activities, the consortium has advances in orienting and navigating, object locating and reaching, laser shooting. Based on current neurocognitive models of human action-perception and spatial cognition, the design of the encoding schemes will lay on common theoretical principles: parsimony (minimum yet sufficient information for a task), congruency (leverage existing sensorimotor control laws), and multimodality (redundant or complementary signals across modalities). To ensure an efficient collaboration all partners will develop and evaluate their transcoding schemes based on common principles, methodology, and tools. An inclusive user-centered “living-lab” approach will ensure constant adequacy of our solutions with VIP’s needs.\nFive labs (three campuses) comprising ergonomists, neuroscientists, engineers, and mathematicians, united by their interest and experience with designing assistive devices for VIP, will duplicate, combine and share their pre-existing SSDs prototypes: a vibrotactile navigation belt, an audio-spatialized virtual guide for jogging, and an object-reaching sonic pointer. Using those prototypes, they will iteratively evaluate and improve their transcoding schemes in a 3-phase approach: First, in controlled experimental settings through augmented-reality serious games in motion capture (virtual prototyping indeed facilitates the creation of ad-hoc environments, and gaming eases the participants’ engagement). Next, spatial interaction subtasks will be progressively combined and tested in wider and more ecological indoor and outdoor environments. Finally, SAM-Guide’s system will be fully transitioned to real-world conditions through a friendly sporting event of laser-run, a novel handi-sport, which will involve each subtask.\nSAM-Guide will develop action-perception and spatial cognition theories relevant to non-visual interfaces. It will provide guidelines for the efficient representation of spatial interactions to facilitate the emergence of spatial awareness in a task-oriented perspective. Our portable modular transcoding libraries are independent of hardware consideration. The principled experimental platform offered by AR games will be a tool for evaluating VIP spatial cognition, and novel strategies for mobility training.\n\n\n\n2 My role in this project\n\n1) I was a major actor behind the birth of this project, by connecting the consortium members together and writing most of the grant proposal (ANR AAPG 2021, funding of 609k€). This project will last 4 years and allow the recruitment of 2 PhD students, one post-doc, and one Research Engineer.\n2) I designed and participated in the development of the second prototype of our vibro-tactile belt, which features wireless communication (thanks to an ESP32 module) and amovible vibrators:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Second prototype of the TactiBelt\n\n\n\n3) I lead the design and development of the project’s experimental platform. The platform uses Unity, connects to various motion tracking devices used by the consortium (Polhemus, VICON, pozyx), uses PureData for sound-wave generation and Steam Audio for 3D audio modeling, and communicates with the consortium’s non-visual interfaces wirelessly.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Testing environment with a PureData audio beacon\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Auto-generated maze with 3D audio beacons on waypoints\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Screenshots from SAM-Guide’s experimental platform (in development)\n\n\n\nThis platform allows one to easily spin up experimental trials by specifying the desired characteristics in a JSON file (based on the OpenMaze project). Unity will automatically generate the trial’s environment according to those specifications and populate it with the relevant items (e.g. a tactile-signal emitting beacon signalling a target to reach in a maze), handle the transition between successive trials and blocks of trials, and log all the relevant user metrics into a data file.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Specifying the avatar and the experimental blocks’ characteristics\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Specifying experimental trials, which can be repeated and randomized within blocks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Examples of settings used to generate experimental trials on the fly.\n\n\n\n4) Handled the experimental design of the first wave of experiments using the TactiBelt for “blind” navigation.\n5) Designed the project’s website using Quarto."

  abstract = {Apnea of prematurity (AOP) affects more than 50\% of preterm infants and leads to perinatal intermittent hypoxia (IH) which is a major cause of morbimortality worldwide. At birth, the human cerebellar cortex is still immature, making it vulnerable to perinatal events. Additionally, studies have shown a correlation between cerebellar functions and the deficits observed in children who have experienced AOP. Yet, the cerebellar alterations underpinning this link remain poorly understood. To gain insight into the involvement of the cerebellum in perinatal hypoxia-related consequences, we developed a mouse model of AOP. Our previous research has revealed that IH induces oxidative stress in the developing cerebellum, as evidenced by the overexpression of genes involved in reactive oxygen species production and the under-expression of genes encoding antioxidant enzymes. These changes suggest a failure of the defense system against oxidative stress and could be responsible for neuronal death in the cerebellum. Building upon these findings, we conducted a transcriptomic study of the genes involved in the processes that occur during cerebellar development. Using real-time PCR, we analyzed the expression of these genes at different developmental stages and in various cell types. This enabled us to pinpoint a timeframe of vulnerability at P8, which represents the age with the highest number of downregulated genes in the cerebellum. Furthermore, we discovered that our IH protocol affects several molecular pathways, including proliferation, migration, and differentiation. This indicates that IH can impact the development of different cell types, potentially contributing to the histological and behavioral deficits observed in this model. Overall, our data strongly suggest that the cerebellum is highly sensitive to IH, and provide valuable insights into the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying AOP. In the long term, these findings may contribute to the identification of novel therapeutic targets for improving the clinical management of this prevalent pathology.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            Background               Apnea of prematurity (AOP) is caused by respiratory control immaturity and affects nearly 50\% of premature newborns. This pathology induces perinatal intermittent hypoxia (IH), which leads to neurodevelopmental disorders. The impact on the brain has been well investigated. However, despite its functional importance and immaturity at birth, the involvement of the cerebellum remains poorly understood. Therefore, this study aims to identify the effects of IH on cerebellar development using a mouse model of AOP consisting of repeated 2-min cycles of hypoxia and reoxygenation over 6~h and for 10~days starting on postnatal day 2 (P2).                                         Results               At P12, IH-mice~cerebella present higher oxidative stress associated with delayed maturation of the cerebellar cortex and decreased dendritic arborization of Purkinje cells. Moreover, mice present with growth retardation and motor disorders. In response to hypoxia, the developing cerebellum triggers compensatory mechanisms resulting in the unaltered organization of the cortical layers from P21 onwards. Nevertheless, some abnormalities remain in adult Purkinje cells, such as the dendritic densification, the increase in afferent innervation, and axon hypomyelination. Moreover, this compensation seems insufficient to allow locomotor recovery because adult mice still show motor impairment and significant disorders in spatial learning.                                         Conclusions               All these findings indicate that the cerebellum is a target of intermittent hypoxia through alterations of developmental mechanisms leading to long-term functional deficits. Thus, the cerebellum could contribute, like others brain structures, to explaining the pathophysiology of AOP.},

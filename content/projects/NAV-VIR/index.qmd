description: "Developing a multi-modal interface for Visually Impaired People to virtually explore a map in order to prepare for a journey"

abstract: |
  The goal of the NAV-VIR project was to develop a multimodal interface to allow Visually Impaired People in virtually discovering and exploring unknown areas from the safety of their home. It relies on an interactive Force-Feedback Tablet, the F2T, and an immersive HRTF-based 3D audio simulation relying on binaural recordings of real environments.

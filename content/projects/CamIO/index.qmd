abstract: |
  CamIO is a system to make physical objects (such as documents, maps, devices and 3D models) accessible to blind and visually impaired persons, by providing real-time audio feedback in response to the location on an object that the user is touching. CamIO currently works on iOS using the built-in camera and an inexpensive hand-held stylus made out of paper and cardboard or wood.

## [TODO] My role in this project 

**My role in this project was two-fold:**

1) Explore software solutions to improve the localisation & tracking capabilities of the device.

<!--# TODO: insert iLocalize & Indoor Atlas -->

2) Assist in writing a [scientific paper](/content/pubs/ICCHP20/) presenting the project.

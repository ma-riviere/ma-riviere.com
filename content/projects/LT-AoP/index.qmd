abstract: |
  This study aimed to identify the effects of AoP on cerebellar development, and to demonstrate that the cerebellum is vulnerable to AoP. This was shown via enzymatic assay studies and RT-qPCR. Results confirmed the presence of alterations of cellular mechanisms, such as oxidative stress, leading to a delay in cerebellar maturation. This was further assessed through visible changes in cellular phenotype and histology via immunocytochemistry. Furthermore, behavioral studies showed that functional and behavioral alterations persisted in adulthood.

# Summary

The LT-AoP project included behavioral, immunohistochemistry and RT-qPCR data, which were analysed in R, hosted on GitHub, and archived with Zenodo. Data were modeled through the Generalized Linear Mixed Model (GLMM) framework, using the [glmmTMB](https://glmmtmb.github.io/glmmTMB/) package [@glmmTMB]. Random intercepts were added to account for the correlation between pseudo-replicates. Temporally-dependent repeated measures were modeled using auto-regressive (AR1) terms.

The optimal likelihood families were selected based on our theoretical understanding of the variable’s properties, and to minimize Aikake's Information Criterion (AIC). Count data (e.g., cell counts, number of maze entries, …) were modeled using a Generalized Poisson likelihood, measures bound at 0 (e.g., cell density, volumes, weights, …) were modeled using a Gamma likelihood, and proportions (e.g., ratios of areas) with a Beta likelihood.

Model diagnostics were done using the [DHARMa](https://florianhartig.github.io/DHARMa/) [@DHARMa] & [performance](https://easystats.github.io/performance/) [@performance] packages, and estimated marginal means/contrasts were computed with the [emmeans](https://github.com/rvlenth/emmeans) package [@emmeans].

A website documenting the analyses and their results was generated using Quarto, to allow interested readers to explore our data & models' outputs without having to run the code themselves.

### My role in this project

**1)** Handled the data processing and analysis, for both immunohistochemistry and RT-qPCR data (R/Markdown).

**2)** Helped write the methodology/statistics part of the [paper](https://agalic-rd.com/content/pubs/articles/CB22/) [@lerouxIntermittentHypoxiaMouse2022].

**3)** Open-source the [code](https://github.com/ma-riviere/LT-AoP-22) and registered on [Zenodo](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6480947).

**4)** Made [a website](https://ma-riviere.github.io/LT-AoP-22/) documenting and showcasing the project's data, analyses, and results. The website uses Quarto and relies on templates to automatically generates documentation for each of the ~70 variables analyzed during the project.

# Quarto website

We made a **Quarto website** to showcase the project's data, analyses, and results with interactive plots and tables:

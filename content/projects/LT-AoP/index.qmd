## My role in this project

**My role within this project was two-fold:**

1) Handle the data processing and analysis, for both immunohistochemistry and RT-qPCR data.

2) Make [a website](https://ma-riviere.github.io/LT-AoP-22/) documenting and showcasing the project's data, analyses, and results. The website uses Quarto and relies on templates to automatically generates documentation for each of the ~70 variables analyzed during the project:

  SAM-Guide is a inter-disciplinary collaboration project between three sites: (1) the [LPNC](https://lpnc.univ-grenoble-alpes.fr/) and [GIPSA](http://www.gipsa-lab.fr/en/about-gipsa-lab.php) laboratories from the Grenoble-Alpes University, (2) the [CMAP](https://portail.polytechnique.edu/cmap/en) from Ecole Polytechnique in Paris-Saclay, and the [LITIS](https://www.litislab.fr/en/) and [CERREV](http://ufrhss.unicaen.fr/recherche/cerrev/) from Normandy University.

## Project summary

<!-- # TODO: summarizes this -->

Interacting with space is a constant challenge for Visually Impaired People (VIP) since spatial information in Humans is typically provided by vision. Sensory Substitution Devices (SSDs) have been promising Human-Machine Interfaces (HMI) to assist VIP. They re-code missing visual information as stimuli for other sensory channels. Our project redirects somehow from SSD’s initial ambition for a single universal integrated device that would replace the whole sense organ, towards common encoding schemes for multiple applications.

SAM-Guide will search for the most natural way to give online access to geometric variables that are necessary to achieve a range of tasks without eyes. Defining such encoding schemes requires selecting a crucial set of geometrical variables, and building efficient and comfortable auditory and/or tactile signals to represent them. We propose to concentrate on action-perception loops representing target-reaching affordances, where spatial properties are defined as ego-centered deviations from selected beacons.

The same grammar of cues could better help VIP to get autonomy along with a range of vital or leisure activities. Among such activities, the consortium has advances in orienting and navigating, object locating and reaching, laser shooting. Based on current neurocognitive models of human action-perception and spatial cognition, the design of the encoding schemes will lay on common theoretical principles: parsimony (minimum yet sufficient information for a task), congruency (leverage existing sensorimotor control laws), and multimodality (redundant or complementary signals across modalities). To ensure an efficient collaboration all partners will develop and evaluate their transcoding schemes based on common principles, methodology, and tools. An inclusive user-centered “living-lab” approach will ensure constant adequacy of our solutions with VIP’s needs.

Five labs (three campuses) comprising ergonomists, neuroscientists, engineers, and mathematicians, united by their interest and experience with designing assistive devices for VIP, will duplicate, combine and share their pre-existing SSDs prototypes: a vibrotactile navigation belt, an audio-spatialized virtual guide for jogging, and an object-reaching sonic pointer. Using those prototypes, they will iteratively evaluate and improve their transcoding schemes in a 3-phase approach: First, in controlled experimental settings through augmented-reality serious games in motion capture (virtual prototyping indeed facilitates the creation of ad-hoc environments, and gaming eases the participants’ engagement). Next, spatial interaction subtasks will be progressively combined and tested in wider and more ecological indoor and outdoor environments. Finally, SAM-Guide’s system will be fully transitioned to real-world conditions through a friendly sporting event of laser-run, a novel handi-sport, which will involve each subtask.

SAM-Guide will develop action-perception and spatial cognition theories relevant to nonvisual interfaces. It will provide guidelines for the efficient representation of spatial interactions to facilitate the emergence of spatial awareness in a task-oriented perspective. Our portable modular transcoding libraries are independent of hardware consideration. The principled experimental platform offered by AR games will be a tool for evaluating VIP spatial cognition, and novel strategies for mobility training.

<!-- # TODO

- This project will finance the recruitment of two PhD students, one post-doc and one Research Engineer
- SAM-Guide uses ... Unity / Motion Capture
- Image of second TactiBelt

## My role in this project

**My role in this project is many-fold:**

- Before the project began, I put connected the consortium members together, organised meetings and wrote most of the grant proposal (ANR AAPG 2021, funding of 609k€)  
- Since then, I lead the design and development of the project's experimental platform (a series of automated testing environment in Unity)  
- I also participated in the development of the second prototype of the vibro-tactile belt (which includes wireless communication and amovible vibrators)

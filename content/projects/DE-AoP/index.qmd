abstract: |
  This work aims at shedding light on the mechanisms underlying cerebellar hypoxic injury. To this end, a transcriptomic study (by RT-qPCR) of genes involved in oxydative stress, cell differentiation, and migration was performed. We analyzed the expression of these genes in different developmental stages (P4, P8, P12, P21 and adults), and in different cell types, using laser capture microdissection to separate cerebellar layers. This project provides cues to better understand the cellular and molecular aspects of AoP-induced cerebellar injury.

# My role in this project
***

**1)** Developed tools to assist the project's researchers in exploring their data. Among those tools, I coded and hosted a modular [
Shiny dashboard](https://mar-studio.shinyapps.io/ShinyQPCR2/) to assist in the data exploration process.

**2)** Handle the RT-qPCR data processing and analysis *(ongoing)*.

**3)** Participate in writing the [journal article](/content/pubs/IP23/) summarizing the results of this project *(ongoing)*.

## Project's summary

*To Be Completed*

<!--# TODO: circlize ? -->

## My role in this project

**My role within this project is three-fold:**

1) Develop tools to assist the project's researchers exploration of the collected data. To this end, I developed a modular [
Shiny dashboard](https://mar-studio.shinyapps.io/ShinyQPCR2/) to assist in the data exploration process.

2) Handle the RT-qPCR data processing and analysis.

3) Participate in writing the final scientific paper resulting from this project *(ongoing)*

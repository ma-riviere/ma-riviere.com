description: "Developing a wearable visuo-auditive substitution system to assist Visually Impaired People in navigation and object-reaching tasks."

abstract: |
  The AdViS project aims to develop a wearable device that will assist Visually Impaired People during **spatial interaction tasks** (such as **indoor navigation** and **object-reaching**), using an audio-based Human-Machine Interface which converts relevant spatial metrics into ergonomic auditory cues.

## Project's summary

AdViS aims to explore various ways to provide visuo-spatial information through auditory feedback, based on the Sensory Substitution framework. Since its inception, the project investigated visuo-auditive substitution possibilities for multiple tasks in which vision plays a crucial role:

-   Navigating a small maze using a depth-map-to-auditory-cues transcoding  
-   Finger-guided image exploration (on a touch screen)  
-   Eye-movement guided image exploration (on a turned off computer screen)  
-   Pointing towards and reaching a virtual target in 3D space using a motion capture environment

:::

The AdViS platform is coded in C++ (and Qt for the GUI).
It currently uses [PureData](https://puredata.info/) for complex sound generation, and the [VICON](https://www.vicon.com/) system to track participant's movements in an augmented reality environment.

## My role in this project

**My role within this project was four-fold:**

1)  Propose a new model for image exploration using a touch-to-audio-feedback loop, where a VIP explores an image by moving its finger across it and gets auditive feedback from the explored regions and its surroundings.

2)  Modify the existing AdViS code to include the ability to transcode grey-scale images into soundscapes, and to capture finger movements information on a touchscreen.

3)  Organize experimental evaluations with blindfolded students, tasked with recognizing geometrical shapes on a touchscreen, and analyse the results.

4)  Participate in implementing an eye-tracking-to-audio-feedback loop in order to evaluate the possibility of exploring images (on a turned off screen) with eye-movements (which are still controllable by most of the non-congenital VIP).

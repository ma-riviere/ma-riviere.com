description: "Developing a wearable vibro-tactile electronic Orientation & Travel Aid for the autonomous navigation of VIP, based on Spatial Cognition models"

abstract: |
  The ACCESSPACE project aims to develop an electronic Orientation and Travel Aid that will provide Visually Impaired People (VIP) with a dynamic and specialized representation of their environment’s spatial topography, through egocentric vibrotactile feedback. Information on the user's location & surroundings will be acquired using their smartphone, processed, and communicated back to them through a waist belt fitted with vibrators. With some training, this substituted spatial information will allow VIP to intuitively form mental maps of their surroundings, and navigate autonomously towards their destination.

## Project's summary

<!--# TODO: summary: two main components: belt & software to localize / extract important spatial information from the environment -->

ACCESSPACE's goal is to allow VIP to navigate indoors or outdoors in autonomy, helping them intuitively perceive where they are, where they want to go, to choose how to get there, and avoid the incoming obstacles on their way. By not having to blindly follow directions, and by progressively learning the topography of their environment, ACCESSPACE will help VIP feel less lost when in novel environments, improving their feeling of safety and autonomy, their mobility, and their integration in our society.

## My role in this project

:::{.callout-note appearance="minimal"}

## My role in this project was many-fold:  

- Participated in the design of the vibro-tactile belt (aka **TactiBelt**).
- Participated in the development of a [Java application](https://github.com/ma-riviere/BeltControl) to control and test the TactiBelt.
- Handling the preliminary experimental evaluations to improve upon the design.
- Review the related literature around navigation assisitive devices for VIP.
- Presenting the project through [scientific papers](/content/pubs/ICCHP18-TactiBelt/), talks at [conferences](/content/outreach/talks/ICCHP18/), and outreach events (see the *dissemination section* below for more details).

## Project's dissemination

The ACCESSPACE project was promoted in various mainstream and technical media, such as:  
- On [RTL](https://www.rtl.fr/actu/sciences-tech/tactbelt-la-ceinture-qui-aide-les-non-voyants-a-se-diriger-7797538766), a French national radio station  ({{< iconify twemoji flag-france >}})

- On [FIRAH](https://www.firah.org/fr/accesspace.html), the French Foundation on Applied Research for Handicap ({{< iconify twemoji flag-france >}})

This project has been warmly welcomed by the VIP community and was awarded the “Applied research on disability” award from the CCAH in 2017.

description: "Developing a wearable vibro-tactile electronic Orientation & Travel Aid for the autonomous navigation of VIP, based on Spatial Cognition models."

abstract: |
  The ACCESSPACE project aims to develop an electronic Orientation and Travel Aid that will provide Visually Impaired People (VIP) with a dynamic and specialized representation of their environment‚Äôs spatial topography, through egocentric vibrotactile feedback. Information on the user's location & surroundings will be acquired using their smartphone, processed, and communicated back to them through a waist belt fitted with vibrators. With some training, this substituted spatial information will allow VIP to intuitively form mental maps of their surroundings, and navigate autonomously towards their destination.

# Project summary
***

ACCESSPACE's high-level goal was to allow VIP to navigate indoors or outdoors in autonomy, helping them intuitively perceive where they are, where they want to go, to choose how to get there, and avoid the incoming obstacles on their way. 

ACCESSPACE had three main axes of research:  
**1)** Devise an intuitive and efficient way to provide real-time spatial cues through tactile signals  
**2)** Design a haptic interface that allows to communicate said spatial representation easily to the user  
**3)** Implement the software require to support the various functions of this interface (e.g. Indoor Localisation, Obstacle Detection, Mapping, ...)

## Our interface: the TactiBelt

## Our tools

**1)** Obstacle detection and indoor localisation using the [ORB-SLAM](https://github.com/raulmur/ORB_SLAM2) algorithm:

**2)** Depth estimation from a monocular RGB camera, using the [MonoDepth](https://github.com/mrharicot/monodepth) algorithm:

**3)** Generating a mobility graph of the environment during movement using Reinforcement Learning:

Applied to an artificial agent exploring a virtual maze, looking for food:

Applied to a real agent (human pushing a cart with a camera and the computer running the algorithm around a meeting table):

**4)** Creating a virtual environment to test the TactiBelt and our candidate spatial encoding schemes:

This project has been warmly welcomed by the VIP community and was awarded the **‚ÄúApplied research on disability‚Äù award from the CCAH** in 2017 ü•á.

# My role in this project
***

**1)** Managed the literature review for all axes of the project (spatial cognition, assistive devices, sensory substitution, computer vision, ...).

**2)** Designed the TactiBelt and participated in its conception (Arduino).

**3)** Participated in the development of a [Java application](https://github.com/ma-riviere/BeltControl) to control and test the TactiBelt.

**4)** Handled the preliminary experimental evaluations of the TactiBelt.

**5)** Presenting the project a a [journal paper](/content/pubs/JEP22/), a [conference paper](/content/pubs/ICCHP18-TactiBelt/), a talk at an [international conference](/content/outreach/talks/ICCHP18/), and various outreach events (see the *dissemination section* above for more details).

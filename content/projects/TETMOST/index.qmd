description: "Developping a haptic interface and studying ways to intuitively represent images and Art pieces haptically for Visually Impaired People."

abstract: |
  The goal of the TETMOST project was to make Art more accessible to Visually Impaired People. The project had two main axes: (1) researching and experimenting to find the most intuitive way to transcode an image into haptic sensations whilst retaining its original meaning and peculiarities, and (2) developping a novel haptic interface allowing VIP to explore images with their fingers.

## Exploring existing haptic interfaces

We researched and tried different categories of haptic interfaces in order to asses their strengths and weaknesses for our purposes:

:::{#fig-device-types layout='[32,34,34]' layout-valign="center"}

![Electro-friction interfaces](friction.png){#fig-elec fig-alt="Photo of the Hap2U interface"}

![Vibrational interfaces](gloves.png){#fig-vibro fig-alt="Photo of the vibrotactile gloves"}

The three main categories of haptic interfaces

:::

Our experience with the existing categories of haptic interfaces allowed us to designed one best adapted to our need: the **Force-Feedback Tablet (F2T)**

## Our interface: F2T (v1)

The first prototype of the F2T was assembled with legos and a camera to better asses the position of the joystick within the frame of the device.

## Our tools

**1)** We developed a Java application to create or convert images into simplified tactile representations, which can then be explored using the F2T:

![](F2T-interface.png){fig-alt="Screenshot of the F2T control interface"}

**2)** In order to display an image haptically, we first needed a way to simplify the image's content without losing its meaning. To do so, we explored various Computer Vision techniques such as image segmentation and edge detection:

:::{layout='[48,52]'}

# My role in this project
***

**1)** Participate in the development of a [Java app](https://github.com/ma-riviere/F2T-interface) to control the F2T and display tactile "images".

**2)** Reviewing the literature and finding existing haptic interfaces, classifying them based on our needs, and buying/lending a prorotype from each category.

**3)** Organizing experimental evaluations with VIP to see the strengths and weaknesses of each type.

**4)** Participate in writing a [poster](poster.pdf) and two conference articles: one on the [F2T](/content/pubs/ICCHP18-F2T/), and one on the [image segmentation](/content/pubs/ICISP20/).
